                <p>Our planet is under threat. The space is filled with asteroids... Do yoy want to be a Space Saviour? So, just do it! Get into your spaceship and protect the space. Don't forget to wear a spacesuit! Fly to the center of this chaos of flying asteroids. Use your spaceship lasers to split and destroy them. You have to destroy as many asteroids as possible so that we can survive.</p>

                <h2>How to play?</h2>
                <p>It's easy to control your spaceship. Use <span>Left</span> and <span>Right</span> buttons to rotate and <span>Up</span> to boost the spaceship. Of course you can just avoid danger, but your main goal is to kill. Use the <span>Spacebar</span> or <span>LMB</span> to fire. Something didn't work out? Press <span>R</span> to restart the game. 'No Time For Caution' from Interstellar will give the right atmosphere, but if you are tired use <span>M</span> to mute it.</p>

                <p>We understand that you, as a superhero, always have different tasks to save the world. But please don't forget about the space. You can easily do your mission on mobile phone. Just use special <span>Sticks</span> to rotate and any tap to attack. It's easy for you and so important for the whole world...</p>
